 Hello, this is James and I'm 23 years old. And when I was a kid, I always thought I want to be a scientist in the future. And when I was around 12 or 13, I want to be a basketball player.

 Oh, that's lovely to hear James. I'm glad to hear you're from Beijing. I hear their beef there is very tasty. I would like to try some one day. Thank you.
